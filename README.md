Hey there 👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼

This project tries to follow the principles of clean architecture in flutter by introducing the 
concept of modularisation the idea was sparked after learning more about the benefits of 
clean architecture and modularisation from a native android perspective and from the resource linked below.

Resources Used: 
[Blog](https://medium.com/flutter-community/modular-flutter-apps-design-and-considerations-59c5ac65352),
[Repo](https://github.com/Vanethos/flutter_modular_app/tree/feature/modular_approach)

## Features
* Clean Architecture with Bloc (State management library with flutter)
* Dartz(Functional programming in dart)
* SqFlite(for offline caching)
* Get It for dependency injection
* GitHub actions for CI

## Libraries

* [Sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite) Used for caching network response locally for offline viewing 
* [Bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) state management solution with a UniDirectional flow approach
* [GetIt](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) used for dependency injection
* [Dartz](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) Introduces the concept of functional programming in dart
