A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

Flutter Movies is a flutter application aimed to demonstrate some key principles of software development such as SOLID principles, Inversion of control and dependency injection.
The App fetches movies from the Movie DB API and saves it in a local storage using the [Sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite) plugin in flutter, which the UI observes , making it an offline first application.
The app is split up into different packages and modules with different functionalities such as pagination, Get_It for dependey injection and Search using flutters search Delegate widget.
