Hey there 👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼

This project tries to follow the principles of clean architecture in flutter by introducing the 
concept of modularisation the idea was sparked after learning more about the benefits of 
clean architecture and modularisation from a native android perspective and from the resource linked below.

Resources Used:
